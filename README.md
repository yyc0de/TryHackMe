# TryHackMe Write-Ups Repository

Welcome to my **TryHackMe Write-Ups** repository!

In this repository, I’ll be uploading all the write-ups I’ve completed for **TryHackMe** rooms and exercises. These write-ups are my personal journey and learning experience while tackling various cybersecurity challenges. The goal is to provide an informative and detailed account of the steps I took to successfully complete each room, with explanations of the tools, techniques, and methodologies used. 

Whether you’re a beginner just starting in cybersecurity or an experienced professional looking to learn new tricks, you might find these write-ups useful. Feel free to use them as a reference, or even contribute your own insights!

## What You'll Find Here

- **Step-by-step guides** on how I tackled specific TryHackMe rooms.
- **Detailed explanations** of tools and techniques used during the exploitation and enumeration phases.
- **Screenshots** and **commands** that I used to solve challenges.
